                        Phytoplankton are freely flowing microscopic organisms that live in both fresh and saltwater environments.

                        Like plants on land, phytoplankton consume carbon dioxide and release oxygen. They have chlorophyll which allows them to use energy from the sun through photosynthesis. Due to this, phytoplankton live in the well-lit surface areas of oceans and lakes.

                        <br>
                        Nearly all sea organisms consume oceanic phytoplankton, whether directly or indirectly.

                        <br>
                        With the right conditions, phytoplankton can multiply very fast, leading to a phenomenon called a bloom. Some species of phytoplankton produce harmful biotoxins - their blooms are toxic and can kill marine life and people who eat seafood that has been contaminated. Even non-toxic phytoplankton can cause harm through mass accumulation - a bloom can prevent sunlight from reaching submerged vegetation, cause oxygen depletion or disrupt food-web dynamics.
                        Uneaten organisms and animal parts that were not consumed during feeding end up at the bottom of the ocean, where bottom-dwelling scavengers like many crabs and lobsters may eat them. Any organic material that is not consumer is decomposed by bacteria. The resulting waste then becomes nutrients that can be used by the producers, and the cycle continues/
