### NASASpaceApps2023OceanGardens ###
 
A purely frontend exploration into css animations, designed to be an educational tool to teach children about vital stages of the marine ecosystem. Created as part of the NASA International Space Apps Challenge 2023. This project was coded in HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.

## The Home Page ##

I was reponsible for the programming of the entirety of the home page. It allowed for me to take a deep foray into css animations and making them seem more organic. This proved to be a bit of a challenge at first, but eventually I managed to get it going to the standard that I wanted. This involved creating seperate animation tracks that were inverts of each other, moving fish divs from one side of the screen to the other, and then teleporting them back to the start once they were on screen.

It is worth noting that the images of the fishes are equally as clickable as the dropdown div above for going onto the next pages. This was done for children to have the option of challenging themselves into attempting to click on the fishes, with their reward being the information about the fish that they have clicked on.

## Phytoplankton ##

The gimmick of this page was that we wanted to show the growing process of a strain of algae over a period of time in the water. To do this, I coded a slider, that when slid along would showcase different images, visually showcasing the increase in amount of phytoplankton over time.

## Aquatic Food Web ##

This page was kept relatively simple and just shows a graphic explaining the general process of which energy is transported between organisms via ingestion.

## Carbon Cycle ##

Last but not least, the carbon cycle page had the lofty goal of trying to push to users the degree to which phytoplankton can offset the CO2 emmisions of a vehicle. This was done through an interactive input box that calculates the amount of phytoplankton required to offset the C02 emissions for cars of different types.
